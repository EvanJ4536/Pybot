To run this script you must be logged into Old School Runescape and be standing in front of the nails vendor outside of Varrock. 
It will use image detection to buy all the vendors bronze and iron nails then switch worlds and do it again.
It wont stop when your inventory is full, after youre done you can sell them for profit on the Grand Exchange.
