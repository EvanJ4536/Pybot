I did my best to remove everything that wasnt hsv related so its buggy but it works.  

to close the program properly CTRL+C when powershell/cmd is the active window

**if you dont use Runelite then you will have to edit line 13.**

Download the folder and run main.py while Runescape is open.  

2 windows will open, one for viewing the hsv filter in real time over the target window, and one for HSV value editing.
